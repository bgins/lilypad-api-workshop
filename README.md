# lilypad-api-workshop

This project demonstrates a simple call to the Lilypad Anura API.

### Usage

Visit https://anura.lilypad.tech/ to request an API key. Set your API key as an environment variable.

```bash
export ANURA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

Start the chat client.

```
go run .
```

You will be asked which model you would like to use, then you can start chatting.

### Credits

Most of this code was written by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. I haven't looked it over that closely, so take it with a grain of salt.
